Description: Defragmenter (rewrite fragmented or misplaced files)
 Shake is a defragmenter that runs in userspace.
 There is no black magic involved : it works just by rewriting
 misplaced fragments. But it has some heuristics that could make it
 more efficient than other tools, including defrag and, maybe,
 xfs_fsr.
